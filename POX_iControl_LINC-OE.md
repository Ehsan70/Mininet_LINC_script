<b>Goal</b>: Seting up LINC-OE simple optical topology controlled by iControl and a packet simple topology controlled by POX. 

<b>Requirements:</b>
A basic knowlege of LINC-OE, TAP interfaces, POX, Erlang language and linux CLI is required. 
Doing https://github.com/Ehsan70/Mininet_LINC_script/blob/master/LINCoe_and_iControl.md tutorial is a must. 

<b>Road Map: </b>This document has two sections for setup: 

 1. setting up the optical network   
 2. setting up the packet network
