<b>Goal</b>: First quickly setting up LINC-OE simple optical topology controlled by iControl and a packet simple topology controlled by POX. Then trying to perform Lambda Switching on one of the optical switches. 
<b>Requirements:</b>
A basic knowlege of LINC-OE, TAP interfaces, POX, Erlang language , Lambda Switchin and linux CLI is required. 
Doing [this tutorial](https://github.com/Ehsan70/Mininet_LINC_script/blob/master/POX_iControl_LINC-OE.md) is a must. 

<b>Environment: </b> I have used the VM from sdn hub, I recommond you do the same. Link for installation is provided below: http://sdnhub.org/tutorials/sdn-tutorial-vm/

<b>Road Map: </b>This document has two sections for setup: 

 1. setting up the optical and packet network </br>
 2. performing Lambda switching
